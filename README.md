## Introduction
Hello! My name is Christian and I am a self-taught programmer willing to learn new things and improve where I can (if you see anything that can be improved on with my code, I encourage you to point it out and give suggestions on how to improve if possible!). I am mostly interested in network programming along with designing/developing firewalls and (D)DoS protection.

I am currently working as a DevOps Engineer at Gameserverkings developing (D)DoS protection.

## My Main Projects (Present/Past)
* [GFL (Games For Life)](https://GFLClan.com/) - A multi-gaming community that hosts game servers for many different games (founded and owned from January 25th, 2011 to July 13th, 2021).
* [Browser.TF](https://Browser.tf/) - A fast and simple web-sided server browser for the game Team Fortress 2 (source code [here](https://github.com/gamemann/Browser.TF)).

*I also have many open-source projects on my GitHub profile.*

## Languages I Am Familiar With
* C
* Go
* Python
* Elixir
* Lua
* Sourcepawn
* PHP
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* Java
* A bit of C++ and C#

*I am also familiar with Linux and networking.*

## My Road Map
* Create a blog where I can create articles on interesting programming/networking-related topics including guides and more (I love writing about what I'm learning and trying my best to teach others).
* Learn more about the Linux kernel and driver development.
* Learn more about Assembly and optimizing C/low-level programs.
* Learn [the DPDK](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/prog_guide/) (a kernel bypass library for very fast packet processing).
* Learn more about [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol) (networking) and application layer protocols/tunnels.
* Learn about AI.
* Create a unique open-source game server panel.

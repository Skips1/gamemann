Follow me on Twitter [@ChristianDeacon](https://twitter.com/ChristianDeacon)! I'm pushing forward multiple open source projects I believe many developers would be interested in. These projects will involve game and network development with a focus on modding support. Please see my projects below for more details ðŸ™‚

## Why Did You Follow Me?
I **manually** follow users because I'm looking for projects to support and contribute to. I love reading other's code and looking at other's profiles! I also enjoy contributing to the open source community.

## Me, Myself & I
Heya, my name is Christian and I am a self-taught engineer with a love for modding, creating things, and generally having fun & making things that improves other people's lives. I own the [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity) and also actively work on my own open source projects such as [@BestMods](https://github.com/BestMods) and [@Gamecom](https://github.com/gamemann/gamecom)!

[Deaconn](https://deaconn.net/) acts as my portfolio and lists a lot of information regarding my skills, experience, and how to contact me. The website's source code and deployments may be found [here](https://github.com/Deaconn-net)! I hope some of you find the code interesting!

## My Primary Projects
### The Modding Community
<a href="https://moddingcommunity.com/about" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/Deaconn-net/Misc/blob/main/TMC.gif" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/Deaconn-net/Misc/blob/main/TMC.gif" /></a>

We are a community that is taking [modding](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSlROYETsWYlJkqM7y9J5qeHRjh6ZY6Liv0RIkxSX6EjQ7X3_kzQFkp3HNHtebks8YAe3e2QV2lBmka/pub?slide=id.g155efb98b4d_0_10) to the next level by providing a unique marketplace, server and community discovery/browser, and forum for modders. With that said, we are working with open source game engines such as [Godot](https://godotengine.org) to create and improve modding tools.

### Best Mods
[BestMods.io](https://bestmods.io) will be a side project to [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity) and retrieve data via an API. It will list mods and sort them by popularity and ratings!

<a href="https://bestmods.io/" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/BestMods/bestmods/blob/master/preview.jpeg" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/BestMods/bestmods/blob/master/preview.jpeg" /></a>

### Gamecom
[Gamecom.io](https://gamecom.io) will be a side project to [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity) and retrieve data via an API. It will list games, communities, mods, and servers!

<a href="https://gamecom.io/" target="_blank"><img src="preview.jpeg" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/gamemann/gamecom/preview.jpeg" /></a>

### Speedrun: The Game
In addition, we are creating an open-source game called [Speedrun: The Game](https://github.com/speedruntg) that ties into all of the above! This will be a game geared towards the speedrunning community and we will be creating an open-source timer/record library for community or modded servers to use! This timer will include support for external games and we will be providing a record library of speedruns (world records and such). With that said, with full modding support, the community will be able to create their own game modes, flavors, maps, and more for the game! We are looking for anybody with game development/design skills to help out with this project!

If you want to reach out, you may do so using the following ðŸ™‚

## My Secondary Projects
### Community
**[Laid Back Gaming (LBG)](https://lbgaming.co/)** - A new multi-gaming community with a new and improved [Anycast](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/) network.

**[Games For Life (GFL)](https://GFLClan.com/)** - A multi-gaming community that hosts game servers for many different games (founded and owned from January 25th, 2011 to July 13th, 2021). I also developed and maintained a custom [Anycast](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/) [network](https://gflclan.com/forum/959-gfls-network/) for two years under GFL (2019 - 2021).

### Websites
**[Browser.TF](https://Browser.tf/)** - A fast and simple web-sided server browser for the game Team Fortress 2 I created in 2015/2016 while I was in High School (source code [here](https://github.com/gamemann/Browser.TF)).

*Currently down, but will be replaced with the [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity).*

### Other
**[NetConn](https://github.com/Deaconn-net/NetConn)** - Open-source router and firewall software for Linux written in Go. Utilizes Linux's [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp) hook through [(e)BPF](https://ebpf.io/) for fast packet processing.

**[XDP Firewall](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall)** - A firewall that utilizes the Linux kernel's [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp) hook. The XDP hook allows for very fast network processing on Linux systems. This is great for dropping malicious traffic from a (D)DoS attack. IPv6 is supported with this firewall! I hope this helps existing network engineers/programmers interested in utilizing XDP or anybody interested in getting into those fields! (D)DoS mitigation/prevention is such an important part of Cyber Security and understanding the concept of networking and packet flow on a low-medium level would certainly help those who are pursuing a career in the field ðŸ™‚

**[XDP Forwarding](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Forwarding)** - Layer 3/4 packet forwarding software that utilizes the Linux kernel's [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp) hook. The XDP hook allows for very fast network processing on Linux systems. Uses source port mapping similar to [IPTables](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables) and [NFTables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page).

**[GitHub Follow Bot](https://github.com/gamemann/GitHub-Follower-Bot)** - A GitHub Follow Bot that utilizes Django's web framework and Python. The bot comes with many features, but please use at your **own** risk. The bot was made for educational purposes.

**[Packet Batch](https://github.com/Packet-Batch)** - A collection of high-performing applications which act as pen-testing/[DoS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/denial-of-service/) tools (Denial-of-Service). Each tool utilizes a different network library/socket type for flexibility with a goal to generate the most network traffic as possible depending on the configuration. I do **NOT** support using these tools maliciously. I made these tools for educational purposes and hope others may learn from them. Please use these tools **responsibly**.

**[Rust Auto Wipe](https://github.com/gamemann/Rust-Auto-Wipe)** - A tool programmed in Go for automating wipes for [Rust](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/252490/) game servers in [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/). This tool comes with many features including cron scheduling, map seed/world changing, warning system (configurable), host name changes, and more!

**[Pterodactyl Game Server Watch](https://github.com/gamemann/Pterodactyl-Game-Server-Watch)** - A tool programmed in Go to restart hung game servers for [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/) that relies on Valve's A2S_INFO [query](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries#A2S_INFO).

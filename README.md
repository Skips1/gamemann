## Why Did You Follow Me?
I often **manually** follow users because I'm looking for open-source users and projects to support via suggestions or improvements to code (especially smaller projects that deserve support and I can't find otherwise). This allows me to see projects others are working on and I've already found interesting projects like an open-source [Food Delivery back-end](https://github.com/Crunch-Garage/food-delivery)! I also want to mention I have made a [GitHub Follow Bot](https://github.com/gamemann/GitHub-Follow-Bot) for educational purposes that has many features, but I do **not** use this personally since I enjoy manually following users myself which allows me to look at a lot of GitHub profiles, projects, and so on.

Want to be a part of a community that encourages open-source and custom content creation? [The Modding Community](https://moddingcommunity.com/) is for you! We are a new, but ever-expanding community that wants to promote modding, networking, security, and give users a place to share their mods, projects, tools, and more! We have a GitHub organization [here](https://github.com/modcommunity) where we allow developers to contribute via pull requests to our projects directly! We will be providing modders with a marketplace, server and community browser, and hub while also creating open-source mod tools with the community's help and feedback! We are using open-source game engines such as [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org). If you're interested, help us make modding the norm and generally make the gaming, technology, and media industries better!

I've learned all my technical, marketing, and leadership knowledge below from modding games/game servers (networking) and managing large gaming communities since I was twelve years old. This led to me founding the project and trying to push forward network security and guides.

We already have large content creators, game developers, modders, and many others involved! We are using and collaborating with **open-source** game engines to create games and tools with full mod/open-source (free) and cross-play support. We are going to be creating games that may be ran inside of the web browser along with mobile, console (Xbox, Playstation, etc.), and computer applications (Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc.) support. We will have a server/mod browser where users can connect to any community or modded servers that may be provided by any individual, community, or maintainer.

**Note** - We have a [Security And Research](https://moddingcommunity.com/forums/forum/117-security-and-research/) forum category that involves security-related discussions on reverse engineeering, operating systems, networking, AI/machine learning, penetration testing, and more!

### Speedrun: The Game
In addition, we are creating an open-source game called [Speedrun: The Game](https://github.com/speedruntg) that ties into all of the above! This will be a game geared towards the speedrunning community and we will be creating an open-source timer/record library for community or modded servers to use! This timer will include support for external games and we will be providing a record library of speedruns (world records and such). With that said, with full modding support, the community will be able to create their own game modes, flavors, maps, and more for the game! We are looking for anybody with game development/design skills to help out with this project!

## Me, Myself & I
Heya, my name is Christian and I **love** the open-source community! I am a self-taught programmer/network engineer who enjoys learning and progressing with technology. If you find any code/configuration of mine that can be improved on, I encourage you to point it out and create pull requests if necessary!

[Deaconn](https://deaconn.net/) acts as my portfolio which includes a custom-made blog and a lot of information regarding my skills, (professional) experience, and ways to contact me (email and social media). I've created the website's design from scratch and utilize Django's web framework for the back-end using Python. The website's source code and installation/deployment files/guides may be found [here](https://github.com/Deaconn-net)! I hope some of you find the code interesting ðŸ™‚

## My Community Projects
**[The Modding Community (TMC)](https://moddingcommunity.com/)** - A new and exciting project aimed to put more spotlight and support on modding via custom content creation, suggestions on how to improve the modding community, and more! This has huge potential to change gaming, media/content creation, entertainment, and more!

**[Laid Back Gaming (LBG)](https://lbgaming.co/)** - A new multi-gaming community with a new and improved [Anycast](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/) network.

**[Games For Life (GFL)](https://GFLClan.com/)** - A multi-gaming community that hosts game servers for many different games (founded and owned from January 25th, 2011 to July 13th, 2021). I also developed and maintained a custom [Anycast](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/) [network](https://gflclan.com/forum/959-gfls-network/) for two years under GFL (2019 - 2021).

## My Open-Source Projects
### Websites
**[Browser.TF](https://Browser.tf/)** - A fast and simple web-sided server browser for the game Team Fortress 2 I created in 2015/2016 while I was in High School (source code [here](https://github.com/gamemann/Browser.TF)).

### Games
**[Speedrun: The Game](https://github.com/speedruntg)** - An open-source video game made by [The Modding Community](https://moddingcommunity.com/). Will be making an open-source timer/world record library (support for external game use as well) along with allowing the community to create their own flavors/game modes and maps for the game via modding tools and support!

### Other
**[NetConn](https://github.com/Deaconn-net/NetConn)** - Open-source router and firewall software for Linux written in Go. Utilizes Linux's [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp) hook through [(e)BPF](https://ebpf.io/) for fast packet processing.

**[XDP Firewall](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall)** - A firewall that utilizes the Linux kernel's [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp) hook. The XDP hook allows for very fast network processing on Linux systems. This is great for dropping malicious traffic from a (D)DoS attack. IPv6 is supported with this firewall! I hope this helps existing network engineers/programmers interested in utilizing XDP or anybody interested in getting into those fields! (D)DoS mitigation/prevention is such an important part of Cyber Security and understanding the concept of networking and packet flow on a low-medium level would certainly help those who are pursuing a career in the field ðŸ™‚

**[XDP Forwarding](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Forwarding)** - Layer 3/4 packet forwarding software that utilizes the Linux kernel's [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp) hook. The XDP hook allows for very fast network processing on Linux systems. Uses source port mapping similar to [IPTables](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables) and [NFTables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page).

**[GitHub Follow Bot](https://github.com/gamemann/GitHub-Follower-Bot)** - A GitHub Follow Bot that utilizes Django's web framework and Python. The bot comes with many features, but please use at your **own** risk. The bot was made for educational purposes.

**[Packet Batch](https://github.com/Packet-Batch)** - A collection of high-performing applications which act as pen-testing/[DoS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/denial-of-service/) tools (Denial-of-Service). Each tool utilizes a different network library/socket type for flexibility with a goal to generate the most network traffic as possible depending on the configuration. I do **NOT** support using these tools maliciously. I made these tools for educational purposes and hope others may learn from them. Please use these tools **responsibly**.

**[Rust Auto Wipe](https://github.com/gamemann/Rust-Auto-Wipe)** - A tool programmed in Go for automating wipes for [Rust](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/252490/) game servers in [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/). This tool comes with many features including cron scheduling, map seed/world changing, warning system (configurable), host name changes, and more!

**[Pterodactyl Game Server Watch](https://github.com/gamemann/Pterodactyl-Game-Server-Watch)** - A tool programmed in Go to restart hung game servers for [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/) that relies on Valve's A2S_INFO [query](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries#A2S_INFO).

I'm pushing forward multiple open source projects I believe many developers would be interested in who are into web, game, network, or security development & design. These projects have **major** potential to change the direction of gaming on a large scale by using the power of **modding** and **open source** like never seen before! See my projects below for more details ðŸ™‚

Join my Discord [server](https://discord.deaconn.net/) if you want to contact me or want a relaxed server focused on technology, gaming, and sports discussions! Discord is the best way to get in contact with me and I will be posting a lot of updates regarding my projects below there!

### Why Did You Follow Me?
I **manually** follow users because I'm looking for less popular projects to support and contribute to. I love reading code from others and contributing to the open source community!

### My Main Projects
#### Best Mods
[BestMods.io](https://bestmods.io) is an [open source](https://github.com/BestMods) website that lists many mods for any game! It retrieves data from multiple sources on the Internet and is powered by the [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity)! The website is still *in development*.

#### The Modding Community

We are a community that is taking [modding](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSlROYETsWYlJkqM7y9J5qeHRjh6ZY6Liv0RIkxSX6EjQ7X3_kzQFkp3HNHtebks8YAe3e2QV2lBmka/pub?slide=id.g155efb98b4d_0_10) to the next level by providing a unique marketplace, server and community discovery/browser (with match-making systems and flexible integration for game developers), and forum for modders. With that said, we are working with open source game engines such as [Godot](https://godotengine.org) to create and improve modding tools.

We are also creating an open source base game with a focus on modding and cross-platform support! Check it out [here](https://github.com/modcommunity/Base-Game)!

#### Gamecom
[Gamecom.io](https://gamecom.io) is similar to [@BestMods](https://github.com/BestMods) and is also powered by the [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity). However, it will additionally list communities, servers, games, and more!

### Me, Myself & I
```C
printf("Hi!");
```

I am a 24 year old self-taught engineer with a love for modding, creating things, and generally having fun & making things that improves other people's lives. I own the [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity) and also work on open source projects such as [@BestMods](https://github.com/BestMods) and [@Gamecom](https://github.com/gamemann/gamecom)! I have over twelve years of technical, management, and marketing experience and have owned multiple large gaming communities in the past which have hosted popular modded game servers and more!

[Deaconn](https://deaconn.net/) acts as my portfolio and lists a lot of information regarding my skills and experience. The website's source code and deployments may be found [here](https://github.com/Deaconn-net)! I hope some of you find the code interesting!

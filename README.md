## Introduction
Hello! My name is Christian and I am a self-taught programmer willing to learn new things and improve where I can (if you see anything that can be improved on with my code, I encourage you to point it out and give suggestions on how to improve if possible!). I am mostly interested in network programming along with designing/developing firewalls and (D)DoS protection.

## My Main Projects (Present/Past)
* [GFL (Games For Life)](https://GFLClan.com/) - A multi-gaming community that hosts game servers for many different games (founded and owned from January 25th, 2011 to July 13th, 2021). I also developed and maintained a custom [Anycast](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/) [network](https://gflclan.com/forum/959-gfls-network/) for two years under GFL (2019 - 2021).
* [Browser.TF](https://Browser.tf/) - A fast and simple web-sided server browser for the game Team Fortress 2 I created in 2015/2016 while I was in High School (source code [here](https://github.com/gamemann/Browser.TF)).
* [XDP Firewall](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall) - A stateless firewall that attaches to the Linux [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp) hook for fast packet processing.
* [XDP Forwarding](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Forwarding) - A program that attaches to the Linux [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp) hook for fast packet processing and performs layer 3/4 forwarding. It also uses source port mapping similar to [IPTables](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables) and [NFTables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page)!
* [Packet Batch](https://github.com/Packet-Batch) - A project for pen-testing and network monitoring. Can act as a [DoS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/denial-of-service/) (Denial of Service) tool for pen-testing purposes.
* [Pterodactyl Game Server Watch](https://github.com/gamemann/Pterodactyl-Game-Server-Watch) - A tool programmed in Golang to restart hung game servers for [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/) that relies on Valve's A2S_INFO [query](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries#A2S_INFO).

*I also have many other open-source projects on my GitHub profile!*

## Languages I Am Familiar With
* C
* Go
* Python
* Elixir
* Lua
* Sourcepawn
* PHP
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* Java
* A bit of C++ and C#

*I am also familiar with Linux and networking.*

## My Road Map
* Create a blog where I can create articles on interesting programming/networking-related topics including guides and more (I love writing about what I'm learning and trying my best to teach others).
* Learn more about the Linux kernel and driver development.
* Learn more about Assembly and optimizing C/low-level programs.
* Learn [the DPDK](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/prog_guide/) (a kernel bypass library for very fast packet processing).
* Learn more about [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol) (networking) and application layer protocols/tunnels.
* Learn about AI.

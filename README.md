## Introduction
Hello! My name is Christian. I am a self-taught programmer willing to learn new things and improve where I can (if you see anything that can be improved on with my code, I encourage you to point it out and give suggestions on how to improve if possible!).

## The Modding Community (TMC)
I've learned all my technical, marketing, and leadership knowledge below from modding games/game servers (network) and managing large gaming communities. This lead to me founding a major project called [The Modding Community](https://moddingcommunity.com/) (TMC). We are a community with goals to shine spotlight and support onto the modding community (gaming and media content/entertainment). Our primary goal is to introduce as many new people to the modding community which in return will improve content creation, gaming, careers, talent, and more along with make things like gaming/media more enjoyable.

We already have a few large content creators interested/involved and I'm sure that'll highly grow with our vision/goal when the product is officially released.

## My Website/Portfolio/Blog
[Deaconn](https://deaconn.net/), a website I created, acts as my portfolio. I created the website from scratch using Python and using a CSS library named Bootstrap.

## My Main Projects (Present/Past)
* [TMC (The Modding Community)](https://moddingcommunity.com/) - A new and exciting project aimed to put more spotlight and support on modding in video games via custom content creation, suggestions on how to improve the modding community, and more! 
* [LBG (Laid Back Gaming)](https://lbgaming.co/) - A new multi-gaming community with a new and improved [Anycast](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/) network.
* [Browser.TF](https://Browser.tf/) - A fast and simple web-sided server browser for the game Team Fortress 2 I created in 2015/2016 while I was in High School (source code [here](https://github.com/gamemann/Browser.TF)).
* [GFL (Games For Life)](https://GFLClan.com/) - A multi-gaming community that hosts game servers for many different games (founded and owned from January 25th, 2011 to July 13th, 2021). I also developed and maintained a custom [Anycast](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/) [network](https://gflclan.com/forum/959-gfls-network/) for two years under GFL (2019 - 2021).
* [XDP Firewall](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall) - A stateless firewall that attaches to the Linux [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp) hook for fast packet processing.
* [XDP Forwarding](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Forwarding) - A program that attaches to the Linux [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp) hook for fast packet processing and performs layer 3/4 forwarding. It also uses source port mapping similar to [IPTables](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables) and [NFTables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page)!
* [Packet Batch](https://github.com/Packet-Batch) - A project for pen-testing and network monitoring. Can act as a [DoS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/denial-of-service/) (Denial of Service) tool for pen-testing purposes.
* [Rust Auto Wipe](https://github.com/gamemann/Rust-Auto-Wipe) - A tool programmed in Go for automating wipes for [Rust](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/252490/) game servers in [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/). This tool comes with many features including cron scheduling, map seed/world changing, warning system (configurable), host name changes, and more!
* [Pterodactyl Game Server Watch](https://github.com/gamemann/Pterodactyl-Game-Server-Watch) - A tool programmed in Go to restart hung game servers for [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/) that relies on Valve's A2S_INFO [query](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries#A2S_INFO).

I'm pushing forward multiple open source projects I believe many developers would be interested in who are into web, game, network, or security development & design. These projects have **major** potential to change the direction of gaming on a large scale by using the power of **modding** like never seen before and I am working hard on these projects myself, but any help would be highly appreciated (close to first release)! See my projects below for more details ðŸ™‚

### Why Did You Follow Me?
I **manually** follow users because I'm looking for less popular projects to support and contribute to. I love reading code from others and contributing to the open source community!

### My Primary Projects
#### Best Mods
[BestMods.io](https://bestmods.io) is an [open source](https://github.com/BestMods) website that lists many mods for any game! It retrieves data from multiple sources on the Internet and is powered by the [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity)! The website is still *in development*.

#### The Modding Community

We are a community that is taking [modding](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSlROYETsWYlJkqM7y9J5qeHRjh6ZY6Liv0RIkxSX6EjQ7X3_kzQFkp3HNHtebks8YAe3e2QV2lBmka/pub?slide=id.g155efb98b4d_0_10) to the next level by providing a unique marketplace, server and community discovery/browser (with match-making systems and flexible integration for game developers), and forum for modders. With that said, we are working with open source game engines such as [Godot](https://godotengine.org) to create and improve modding tools.

The projects we're creating or improving have **MAJOR** potential to positively change the direction of gaming on a large scale. Instead of paying money for games where companies couldn't care less about their community or the game itself, our focus is on creating free, open-source, fully moddable with easy to use mod tools (e.g. mapping and modeling), and truly cross-platform games. This allows **the community** to have full control on improving the games and engines themselves since they're open-source, but also creating game modes, maps, servers, materials, models, and **so much more** made easier by modding tools! We are accomplishing this by implementing low-level network code to allow the most popular protocols, [TCP](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/tcp-ip) (e.g. Minecraft or games on the web browser) and [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) (e.g. most games use UDP for multiplayer due to the performance advantages from it being *stateless*), to co-exist with each other in multiplayer games. This with the combination of a workshop system where users securely download all custom files from server and our server browser I've been working hard on, users will easily be able to connect to servers through any application including web browsers and computer/mobile applications, and play with others!

I personally want to bring many loved game modes, maps, servers, and so much more made by the **community** such as Counter-Strike Zombie Escape to open-source games surrounded by a big community that will improve these game modes or create new ones for many others to enjoy. Keep in mind this also includes 2D games as well!

Want to see one example of how powerful modding can be with modded game servers? Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW4EhWVaxVw) of my old popular CS:S Zombie Escape server from ten years ago. The game is made by [Valve](http://valvesoftware.com/) (Counter-Strike: Source), but the game mode, map (Lord Of The Rings Helms Deep), player models, materials, and so much more are made by the **community** (usually all for free other than the game itself) and awesome developers from [SourceMod via AlliedMods](https://forums.alliedmods.net/forumdisplay.php?f=132)! The server was hosted by my old gaming community and I. Keep in mind this game and its tools are **TWENTY YEARS OLD** and have rarely been updated since then because Valve stopped caring for modding support over ten years ago! Yet, many others including myself play this game and its modded servers more than the "new generation" of games since the community keeps making so much content that keeps the game fresh. 

#### Gamecom
[Gamecom.io](https://gamecom.io) is similar to [@BestMods](https://github.com/BestMods) and is also powered by the [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity). However, it will additionally list communities, servers, games, and more!

### Me, Myself & I
```C
printf("Hi!");
```

I am a 24 year old self-taught engineer with a love for modding, creating things, and generally having fun & making things that improves other people's lives. I own the [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity) and also work on open source projects such as [@BestMods](https://github.com/BestMods) and [@Gamecom](https://github.com/gamemann/gamecom)! I have over twelve years of technical, management, and marketing experience and have owned multiple large gaming communities in the past which have hosted popular modded game servers and more!

[Deaconn](https://deaconn.net/) acts as my portfolio and lists a lot of information regarding my skills and experience. The website's source code and deployments may be found [here](https://github.com/Deaconn-net)! I hope some of you find the code interesting!

Follow me on Twitter [@ChristianDeacon](https://twitter.com/ChristianDeacon)! I'm pushing forward multiple open source projects I believe many developers would be interested in. These projects will involve game and network development with a focus on modding support. Please see my projects below for more details ðŸ™‚

### Why Did You Follow Me?
I **manually** follow users because I'm looking for projects to support and contribute to. I love reading code from others and contributing to the open source community.

### Me, Myself & I
Heya, my name is Christian and I am a self-taught engineer with a love for modding, creating things, and generally having fun & making things that improves other people's lives. I own the [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity) and also work on open source projects such as [@BestMods](https://github.com/BestMods) and [@Gamecom](https://github.com/gamemann/gamecom)!

[Deaconn](https://deaconn.net/) acts as my portfolio and lists a lot of information regarding my skills, experience, and how to contact me. The website's source code and deployments may be found [here](https://github.com/Deaconn-net)! I hope some of you find the code interesting!

### My Primary Projects
#### The Modding Community

We are a community that is taking [modding](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSlROYETsWYlJkqM7y9J5qeHRjh6ZY6Liv0RIkxSX6EjQ7X3_kzQFkp3HNHtebks8YAe3e2QV2lBmka/pub?slide=id.g155efb98b4d_0_10) to the next level by providing a unique marketplace, server and community discovery/browser, and forum for modders. With that said, we are working with open source game engines such as [Godot](https://godotengine.org) to create and improve modding tools.

#### Best Mods
[BestMods.io](https://bestmods.io) is an [open source](https://github.com/BestMods) website that lists many mods for any game! It retrieves data from multiple sources on the Internet and is powered by the [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity)! The website is still *in development*.

#### Gamecom
[Gamecom.io](https://gamecom.io) is similar to [@BestMods](https://github.com/BestMods) and is also powered by the [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity). However, it will additionally list communities, servers, games, and more!

#### Speedrun: The Game
Additionally, we are creating an open source game called [Speedrun: The Game](https://github.com/speedruntg)! This game will attract people from the speedrun community and will include a timer & record library for game servers to use! This timer will include support for external games and we will include record libraries of our own for world records and such.
